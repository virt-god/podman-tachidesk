# podman-tachidesk

Edited [docker-tachidesk](https://github.com/Suwayomi/docker-tachidesk) Dockerfile so I could use it with podman without permission issues.

I wouldn't recommend using this for anything outside of your LAN or with docker, as the service is run as the root user inside the container.
